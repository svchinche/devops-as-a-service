Abstract
========
Most of the organization still not using devops tool to make easy their software build cycle to deliver the product customer. 
There are number of reasons for this
- Organizations are using old project building tools like ant and unable to shift entire project to Maven & Gradle due framework dependencies.
- unable to migrate monolithic application to microservices.
- just now started migrating monolithic application to microservice. since application is too big, they started using restapis and slowly migrating to microservices.


Development Phase
=================

- For creating on-premise infrastructure, we uses Vagrant  
- And for creating cloud infrastructure we use terraform.
